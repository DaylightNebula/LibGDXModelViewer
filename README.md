# ScytheModelViewer

Basic model viewer in libgdx for a small game project.

Goals:
Load and view 3d files
 - FBX
 - OBJ
 - BLEND (maybe?)

Allow for creation of some extra stuff that is saved to a json file:
 - colliders
 - transform offsets (position, rotation, scale)
 - animation points to call functions
